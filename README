This is Tickerguy's "android" manifest to build CM7 for the Triumph.
11/6/2011

Why a difference manifest?  Several reasons:

1. The Triumph requires AMSS 50001 for the GPS.  CM7 does not at present
support this so the entire gps directory structure was invalid for this device.
Yes, that's a hack - it probably should have been merged in, but I didn't.
You're free to and then submit it via Gerrit.

2. There are material changes to the RIL; these SHOULDN'T break other devices
but......  

3. There are material changes to MMS handling.  These may also break other
devices.  They were pulled from inferiorhumanorgans work on the Optimus
port for Virgin Mobile.

4. There are a number of other minor changes relating to the msm7k hardware,
specifically, the headphone switch routing.

5. There are significant changes required for the camera; camera support
in this build is an ugly, nasty HACK.  It works, but I'm not proud of it.

To build from "zero" you need both the Froyo load (which you have on a base
phone) and the CHERRY Android code load from which you need files for the
camera and a few other things.  If you don't have both the build will fail.
See the make files in the vendor and device areas for the exact files you
need from each; it's clear if you know what you're doing.

Please note that I have verified that this codebase (along with the REQUIRED
kernel for the Triumph which is a separate repo) builds from "zero base".
